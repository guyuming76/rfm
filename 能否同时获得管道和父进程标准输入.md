# 问题背景 #

通过命令 locate 2023|grep png|rfm 打开rfm后，无法通过GIO channel获得虚拟终端命令窗口的输入

# 解决方案 #
commit f56ba0baefb095b86f414dc9d6bcecaec084207b 和 96eb949d94fdbaac7e2dcef27542f73ee2c83cbc 显示，要先建立GIO channel,然后再从pipe里面读数据，GIO channel 才能工作。

## shell如何建立pipeline ##
A pipe is a buffer allocated in the kernel with file descriptors associated with the read and write ends. When you run cat file.txt | grep -v match:

    The shell creates a pipe (using the pipe() system call)
    The shell fork()s. The child process uses the dup2() system call to close its standard output stream and to duplicate the write end of the pipe to standard output. (After this, writes to standard output will go to the kernel buffer.) Then the child exec()s cat with the updated standard output.
    The shell fork()s again. The child uses the dup2() system call to close its standard input stream and to duplicate the read end of the pipe to standard input. (After this, reads from standard input will come from the kernel buffer.) Then the child exec()s grep with the updated standard input.

terminal捕获到key按键值 <--> ptm <--> pts/3 <--> stdin <--> shell读到数据
shell数据结果 <--> stdout <--> pts/3 <--> ptm <--> terminal显示

## process substitution ##

You are probably expecting read to behave the same way when it’s run without a pipe and wait for user input … Well it won’t as it’s STDIN is tied to the anonymous pipe and the only normally expected input is what comes through that pipe.
A workaround would be using bash's own process substitution syntax i.e. <(...)
